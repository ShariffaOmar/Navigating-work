<h1>RACISM</h1>

<p>
Racism was revealed through the existence of several churches that is; the mixed church, the white church and the black church .The difference among the three churches also reveal differences among the three groups in question. The mixed-race congregation shows the possibility of different races celebrating together, bound by a common belief. The white church shows the centrality of education in the white culture that enjoys the privilege to access it, which also points to how surprising it is for Trevor to out-bible quiz the more advantage white kids at the church. In contrast, the black church shows how suffering and poverty are defining features of blacks’ experience under apartheid.</p>

 During apartheid, one of the worst crimes one would commit was having sexual relations with a person of another race. Laws were passed prohibiting sex between whites and nonwhites. A black man who was caught having sex with a white woman he would be punished and the woman will be sent free without any question. Trevor was born from this scenario. He never got a chance to be with his father in public. He would sneak out together with his mother to visit his dad. He could only be with his father indoors. Since Trevor was also white he could not walk with his mother freely in public. His mother made sure that whenever they were going out she would invite a colored woman who would pretend to be Trevor’s mother and Patricia to be the maid. Trevor did not have the freedom to play outdoors like other kids just because he was colored. His grandmother used to lock him up and he got used to it. </p>

 The contrast between the two places; the white and the black’s. One would often see a police officer at the white’s place. They would operate in team known as fly squads and when a black would see this one would opt to run. The township was in a constant state of insurrection and gunshots, screams could be heard and even tear gas being fired into crowds. Trevor’s grandmother prevented Trevor from playing in the street because the wrong color kid in the wrong color area, and the government could come in, strip your parents of custody, haul one off to an orphanage. There was even the black people who worked for the government. This made Trevor to be used to stay lonely without friends and getting used to the situation. Trevor’s grandmother did not punish him for any mistake even after she punishes others simply because he was white and she used to say that she does not know how to punish a white kid.</p>

 Racism existed even in Trevor’s school. In Trevor’s class it was made of the white. They were separated according to their color. They did not associate and groups moved in color patterns across the yard, up the stairs, down the hall. Trevor went to see the school counselor. He told her that he wants to switch to class B which was made of the blacks. The school counselor told her that he is a smart kid and so he does not deserve to be in that class. She believed that the black kids were not smart and Trevor would be held back by those kids. Under apartheid, the government built what became known as the Bantu schools where no science was or history was taught except how to count potatoes, pave roads, chop wood and till the soil. Mission schools were told to conform to the new curriculum or shut down so most of them shut down, and the black children were forced into crowded classrooms in dilapidated schools, often with teachers who were barely literate themselves. </p>



 <p>
 There was a difference between the white and the black land. The white’s countryside was lush and irrigated and green, while the black lands were overpopulated and overgrazed, the soil depleted and eroding. The black people were to work on the white’s farm. This made the black people to be poor and so Trevor’s mom had to fight with the other bigger kids at home to get a handful of meat or a bone from which to suck out some marrow.</p>

 The ultimate goal of apartheid was to make South Africa a white country with every black person stripped of his or her citizenship relocated to live in the homelands. To live in the city, or for any other reason, you had to carry a pass with your ID number otherwise one could be arrested. After a certain hour, blacks had to be back home in the township or risk arrest.</p>
